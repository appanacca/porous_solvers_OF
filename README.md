# Porous OpenFOAM miscellaneous

The repository contains some of the OpenFOAM extension that I developped for my PhD.
The naming convention is the same one used in the actual [manuscript](https://github.com/appanacca/manuscript).


##Installation: 
All the solvers run on OpenFOAM 3.0.
Some of the test cases initialization need also PyFOAM 0.6.6.

Each solver and utility needs to be installed following the classical openFoam pattern:

>> cd your_solver_directory
>> wmake
